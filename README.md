## Election Audit Summary

* From the way this script is designed to condense data, it can be invaluable in other elections with the proper modifications. One way to possibly modify would be to change the "county" categories to states for a larger election pool. The candidate names can also be modified to reflect that change, or to change the candidates in other state elections.
